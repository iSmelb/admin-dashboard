# Getting Started

To try application, check out the [https://ismelb.github.io/admin-dashboard/](https://ismelb.github.io/admin-dashboard/).

In this project, an example admin panel has been developed. The main page displays a dashboard with information for managing various tasks. Users can view this information in small widgets and can also download reports in Excel format.

The left sidebar is collapsible and allows users to navigate through the application. The "data" pages contain several table examples where users can manage various types of data. The profile form allows users to create a profile for a new person. The calendar page allows users to add events on any date.

There are several pages where data is displayed in different charts. After performing actions such as downloading reports, creating events, or profiles, users receive notifications that are displayed in the top right corner. Users can also switch between a light and dark theme.

In the future, the project will include a configuration workspace option and the ability to save data.
